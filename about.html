                <p class="about-paragraphs">Since Giovanni was a young boy he dreamed of having his own restaurant. Inspired by his grandmother's cooking he wanted to make a great restaurant that captured those memories. Wanting to make that dream a reality, Giovanni has had a lifetime experience to bring it into fruition. From helping his nonna, to studying in university, and up until moving to the United States in 2005. Five years of work and savings had built the funds to open Nonna's Table. In Nonna's Table every bite has a sense of 'grandmother's cooking'. With time and care, Giovanni expanded the restaurant and is recognized in the community as a diamond in the rough that always takes you back to a little town in Italy.</p>

                            I'm so glad I chose to come to Nonna's Table. The service was very friendly, as if I was a guest in someone's home. The food was amazing! We tried the Fettuccine Alfredo with a side of Bruschetta and it was so good as if had melted in our mouths.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Francine Mills</span>

                            When we walked into Nonna's Table, we were immediately greeted by a warm and welcoming staff. As we were guided to our tables, our server made a few suggestions on what to try as our menus were handed to us. I tried the Calamari while my Husband tried the Fish Pasta, and as seafood lovers we were very delighted! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good meal.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Edward Oliver</span>

                            First time eating at Nonna's Table and the food was delicious. We ordered an appetizer Grissini and split an Alfredo e patate soup to start. The soup had a rich flavor and was cooked perfectly. I ordered the scaloppini while my wife ordered the Lasagna. Both were delicious and exceeded expectations. The quality of food for the price can't be beat. I don't know how Nonna's does it, but we will be back.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Lenard V. Cowens</span>

                            This is one of my favorite places to eat on the planet! We stumbled across this place by accident one night. We had planned to eat at a sports bar down the street but as we walked by Nonna's we decided to stop and look at the menu. My kids said they wanted some Fettuccine Alfredo, so my husband and I agreed to eat here. We were not disappointed! The food is very affordable and tasted great. There are many Italian restaurants around here, but none can hold a candle to Nonna's from my experience. Do yourself a favor and stop by Nonna's at least once and give it a try.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Clare T. Tamberino</span>

                            Had a date last night and decided to take her here. The atmosphere is great, we sat in the back near the wall in a booth and our waiter came out to greet us quickly and get our drink order. He asked us if we wanted to try a wine sample, it was delicious, and we decided to order a bottle of wine for our date. The food was delicious, and the portion sizes are generous. We had a wonderful date and we will be sure to come back to Nonna's Table again.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Dwain A. Apelt</span>

                            I stumbled across Nonna's Table when I was using yelp. I was surprised to see they had a section to order from on their website. I ordered something for the next day and when I walked in to the restaurant I was greeted warmly by one of two hostesses. They asked me how they could help me, and I told them I was here for my pick-up order. They were very pleasant and helpful and had me in and out in under a minute. When I got home the food was well packaged and a nice temperature. The food was delicious, and I am glad that I found a new Italian place near me for whenever I get the craving.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Cindie L. Bozich</span>
