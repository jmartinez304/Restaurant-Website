                <p class="about-paragraphs">Since Giovanni was a young boy he dreamed of having his own restaurant. Inspired by his grandmother's cooking he wanted to make a great restaurant that captured those memories. Wanting to make that dream a reality, Giovanni has had a lifetime experience to bring it into fruition. From helping his nonna, to studying in university, and up until moving to the United States in 2005. Five years of work and savings had built the funds to open Nonna's Table. In Nonna's Table every bite has a sense of 'grandmother's cooking'. With time and care, Giovanni expanded the restaurant and is recognized in the community as a diamond in the rough that always takes you back to a little town in Italy.</p>

                    I'm so glad I chose to come to Nonna's Table. The service was very friendly, as if I was a guest in someone's home. The food was amazing! We tried the Fettuccine Alfredo with a side of Bruschetta and it was so good as if had melted in our mouths.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Francine Mills</span>

                <p class="rev2">
                    When we walked into Nonna's Table, we were immediately greeted by a warm and welcoming staff. As we were guided to our tables, our server made a few suggestions on what to try as our menus were handed to us. I tried the Calamari while my Husband tried the Fish Pasta, and as seafood lovers we were very delighted! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good meal.<br/> <span class="rev-name">&#45; Edward Oliver</span>
